# `@pokebag/data-sdk`

## Why Does the Dataset Need Its Own SDK?

This data SDK exists to make it easy to work with [Pok√©bag](https://pokeb.ag)'s Pok√©mon UNITE dataset ([`@pokebag/pokemon-unite-data`](https://github.com/pokebag/pokemon-unite-data)). The dataset is built with the expectation that the data will undergo _cumulative transclusion_ before being used.

### WTF is Cumulative Transclusion?

Cumulative transclusion is a process wherein a complete dataset is compiled by applying ordered patches to a base dataset. This means that, other than the base dataset in `@pokebag/pokemon-unite-data`, no part of the dataset is complete. Rather, all patches beyond the base dataset include only the changes that were made in that patch.

As a contrived example:

* The base dataset contains a data file with a complete view of Charizard.
    ```json
    {
      "displayName": "Charizard",
      "stats": {
        "attack": 15,
        "defense": 20
      },
    }
    ```
* In the base dataset, Charizard's attack is 15.
* In patch 1.1.1.8, Charizard's attack is increased to 20.
* For patches 1.1.1.1 through 1.1.1.7, there will be no data for Charizard.
* In patch 1.1.1.8, there will be a file for Charizard. The only data in the file will be empty, except for the upgrade to Charizard's attack.
    ```json
    {
      "stats": {
        "attack": 15
      },
    }
    ```

This expectation of cumulative transclusion makes it impossible to just retrieve the files for a single patch. Instead, the base dataset must be compiled, then **all** of the patch files must applied to the base dataset to get a complete view of the dataset for a specific patch.

## What's Pok√©bag?
[Pok√©bag](https://pokeb.ag) is a website for Pok√©mon fans! We're currently focused on providing really great content for Pok√©mon UNITE players, but we'll eventually expand to cover far more Pok√©mon games. Check it out at https://pokeb.ag.
